# Talking To AI-Generated People
### Fake Faces, Script, Voice and Lip-Sync Animation

This notebook combines different state-of-the-art image and speech generation neural networks into one single Google Colab Notebook so that we can generate a random fake person's talking head video replying to our input text question.

#### Different Tools/Repositories used:-
1) Face Generation - www.thispersondoesnotexist.com - StyleGAN2
2) Text Generation - www.textsynth.org - OpenAI GPT-2
3) Speech-to-Text Conversion - https://github.com/NVIDIA/flowtron - Flowtron
4) Lip Animation - https://github.com/Rudrabha/LipGAN - LipGAN

#### TODO Improvements (Any Volunteers??) :-
1) Use motion model to animate the face before performing lip-sync.
2) Use the newer GPT-3 model for better, more coherent text responses.
